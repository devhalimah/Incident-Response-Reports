**Incident Response Scenario:**<br>
                                 
An employee at a top tier bank received an email from his coworker, informing him that she was sharing a document with him. He had received documents from her before but wasn't expecting one that day.<br>
The email was vague and had no project details, which was unusual. He clicked the link, and it opened to what looked like the usual file-sharing site the company typically uses.<br>
He was asked to enter his login and password, then got an error message. He tried again and got another error message.<br>

The employee contacted his IT manager to request a password reset and report trouble downloading a shared document. He also mentioned that he called the coworker, and she said she had not sent him anything.<br>
The manager was suspicious that this was likely a hacking incident.<br>
